# Telegram Approve/Deny for Service Submissions

**Date:** 2026-03-20
**Status:** Approved

## Summary

Add ✅ Approve and ❌ Delete inline keyboard buttons to the Telegram notification sent when a new service listing is submitted. Tapping a button from Telegram performs the action directly — no need to open the admin panel.

## Goals

- Admin can approve or delete a pending submission directly from the Telegram notification
- Deleting via Telegram also removes associated Cloudinary images (consistent with admin panel behavior)
- After taking action, the message updates to show the result and buttons are removed

## Non-goals

- Email notification to the submitter on rejection
- Telegram user ID allowlist (secret token validation is sufficient)
- Any changes to the admin panel UI

## Architecture

### Files modified

**`api/submit-service.js`**

Change `.insert(record)` to `.insert(record).select('id').single()` to retrieve the new row's UUID. Pass the ID to `sendTelegramNotification(record, id)`.

**`api/_lib/telegram.js`**

- `sendTelegramNotification(record, serviceId)` gains a `serviceId` parameter
- Message body includes an `inline_keyboard` with two buttons:
  - `[✅ Approve]` → callback_data: `approve_<uuid>`
  - `[❌ Delete]` → callback_data: `delete_<uuid>`
- Extract message text construction into a named helper `buildMessageText(row)` — used both when sending and when reconstructing for edits in the webhook
- `buildMessageText` accepts an object with fields `title`, `category`, `phone`, `email`, `address`, `website` — these match both the `record` shape passed at submission time and the Supabase column names returned by a `select('*')` query, so the same function works in both contexts

**`api/_lib/telegram.js`** also exports `buildMessageText` so the webhook can reconstruct the original HTML body.

### Files created

**`api/_lib/cloudinary.js`**

Shared helper:

```js
export async function deleteCloudinaryImages(imagesCsv) { ... }
```

- If `imagesCsv` is falsy or empty, returns immediately (no-op)
- Parses comma-separated URLs, extracts public IDs via inline regex (duplicated from `src/utils/imageUrl.js` — server-side files cannot import from `src/`)
- Deletes each image independently in a `Promise.allSettled` loop using the same Cloudinary Resources API endpoint as `delete-image.js` (`DELETE /v1_1/<cloud>/resources/image/upload?public_ids[]=<id>`) — individual failures are logged but do not stop remaining images and do not throw; duplicate calls for the same ID are benign (Cloudinary returns success)
- `delete-image.js` is updated to import and use this helper (no behavior change to that endpoint)

**`api/telegram-webhook.js`**

New Vercel serverless POST handler. Vercel gives serverless functions in `/api/` priority over `rewrites` in `vercel.json`, so the existing catch-all rewrite does not intercept this endpoint — no `vercel.json` changes are needed. Verify after deploying by checking the webhook registration response.

**Important:** Telegram requires `answerCallbackQuery` within 10 seconds or the spinner never dismisses. The handler calls it as early as possible — immediately after validating the secret and parsing the callback, before any Supabase or Cloudinary operations. All paths after the secret check return HTTP 200 (Telegram retries on non-200; returning 200 immediately prevents duplicate delivery).

Handler steps:

1. Validate `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` header against `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` — return **401** if missing or wrong (the only non-200 response)
2. Parse `callback_query` from the request body — return **200** immediately if absent (non-button update)
3. Call `answerCallbackQuery(callbackQueryId)` immediately to dismiss the spinner — errors from this call are logged but ignored; the handler continues regardless
4. Extract `action` and `serviceId` from `callback_data`:
   - Split on the first `_` only: `const sep = data.indexOf('_'); action = data.slice(0, sep); serviceId = data.slice(sep + 1)`
   - Validate `serviceId` against UUID regex (`/^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}$/i`) — if invalid, call `editMessageText` with `⚠️ Invalid request` and return 200
   - If `action` is not `approve` or `delete`, call `editMessageText` with `⚠️ Unknown action` and return 200
5. Fetch the service row from Supabase: `select('*').eq('id', serviceId).single()`
   - If not found (row doesn't exist or already deleted): call `editMessageText` with `⚠️ Not found` and return 200
6. **Approve path:**
   - If `row.approved === true`: call `editMessageText` with `ℹ️ Already approved` and return 200
   - Otherwise: `supabase.update({ approved: true }).eq('id', serviceId)`
   - On success: call `editMessageText` with `✅ Approved`
   - On Supabase error: call `editMessageText` with `⚠️ Error: <message>` and return 200
7. **Delete path:**
   - Call `deleteCloudinaryImages(row.images)` — non-blocking on individual failures
   - `supabase.delete().eq('id', serviceId)`
   - On success: call `editMessageText` with `🗑 Deleted`
   - On Supabase error: call `editMessageText` with `⚠️ Error: <message>` and return 200
8. `editMessageText` parameters:
   - `chat_id` = `callback_query.message.chat.id`
   - `message_id` = `callback_query.message.message_id`
   - `text` = `buildMessageText(row)` + `\n\n<result line>` — reconstructed from the fetched service data, **not** from `callback_query.message.text` (which strips HTML tags)
   - `parse_mode: 'HTML'` — must match the original send to preserve `<b>` tags
   - `reply_markup: { inline_keyboard: [] }` — removes the buttons

## Data Flow

```text
User submits form
  → submit-service.js inserts record, gets UUID back
  → sendTelegramNotification(record, id) sends message with inline buttons

Admin taps button in Telegram
  → Telegram POSTs callback_query to /api/telegram-webhook
  → Webhook validates secret header (401 if bad)
  → answerCallbackQuery called immediately (dismisses spinner)
  → Parses and validates action + UUID from callback_data
  → Fetches service row from Supabase (handles not-found for both paths)
  → Performs approve or delete operation
  → editMessageText with reconstructed HTML + status (parse_mode: HTML, buttons removed)
  → Returns 200
```

## Security

- `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` header validated on every request — 401 on failure
- `serviceId` validated against UUID regex before any DB operation
- Service IDs are Supabase-generated UUIDs — unguessable
- All Supabase operations use the service role key (server-side only)
- `chat_id` from `callback_query.message.chat.id` is used for message edits rather than env var, ensuring edits target the correct chat
- All non-401 paths return 200 to prevent Telegram retry loops

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Where | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Vercel (existing) | Bot API calls |
| `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | Vercel (existing) | Where to send notifications |
| `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Vercel (new) | Validate incoming webhook requests — use a random string of 32+ characters |

## One-time Setup

After deploying to production, register the webhook URL once:

```bash
curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}/setWebhook?url=https://<your-app>.vercel.app/api/telegram-webhook&secret_token=${TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET}"
```

Use shell variable substitution (`$VAR`) rather than pasting secrets inline to avoid them appearing in shell history.

Expected response: `{"ok":true,"result":true,"description":"Webhook was set"}`

**Important operational notes:**

- Only one webhook URL can be active per bot at a time — re-registering replaces the previous URL
- Vercel preview deployments get unique URLs; setting the webhook to a preview URL breaks production. To test on a preview branch, use a dedicated staging bot token (`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN_STAGING`) and keep production untouched
- To verify the current webhook: `curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}/getWebhookInfo"`

## Error Handling

| Scenario | HTTP | User-visible feedback |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Invalid/missing secret header | 401 | None (not a Telegram request) |
| Non-button update (no `callback_query`) | 200 | None |
| Invalid UUID in `callback_data` | 200 | `⚠️ Invalid request` in message |
| Unknown `action` prefix | 200 | `⚠️ Unknown action` in message |
| Service not found (deleted or bad ID) | 200 | `⚠️ Not found` in message |
| Already approved (double-tap approve) | 200 | `ℹ️ Already approved` in message |
| Supabase operation fails | 200 | `⚠️ Error: <message>` in message |
| Cloudinary deletion fails (partial) | 200 | Not shown — logged server-side only |
| Double-tap delete | 200 | `⚠️ Not found` (row already gone) |

## Testing

Unit tests:

- `sendTelegramNotification` sends `inline_keyboard` with correct callback_data when `serviceId` is provided
- `buildMessageText` returns the same HTML string regardless of optional fields presence, and produces identical output whether called with the submission `record` shape or a fetched Supabase row (field names match)
- Webhook returns 401 on missing/wrong secret header
- Webhook returns 200 with no-op on non-button update
- Webhook calls `answerCallbackQuery` before any Supabase call
- Webhook returns 200 with edit on invalid UUID in `callback_data`
- Approve path: fetches row first, updates with `approved: true`, edits message with `✅ Approved`
- Approve path: already-approved row returns `ℹ️ Already approved`
- Approve path: missing row returns `⚠️ Not found`
- Delete path: fetches row, calls `deleteCloudinaryImages`, calls `supabase.delete`, edits message with `🗑 Deleted`
- Delete path: missing row returns `⚠️ Not found`
- `editMessageText` call always includes `parse_mode: 'HTML'` and `reply_markup: { inline_keyboard: [] }`
- `deleteCloudinaryImages` is a no-op when called with null or empty string
- `deleteCloudinaryImages` attempts all images even when one fails (per-image isolation)

Manual:

- Submit a test listing, tap Approve in Telegram — verify `approved = true` in DB, message updates to show ✅, buttons removed
- Submit a test listing, tap Delete in Telegram — verify row deleted from DB, Cloudinary images removed, message shows 🗑
- Tap Approve twice rapidly — first shows ✅ Approved, second shows ℹ️ Already approved
- Tap Delete on an already-deleted message — shows ⚠️ Not found
