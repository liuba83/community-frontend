## Critical

### 1. Overpermissive RLS Policy

**File:** `supabase/admin-rls.sql`

```sql
create policy "Admin full access" on services
  for all
  using (auth.role() = 'authenticated')
  with check (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

Any authenticated Supabase user — not just your admin — gets full read/write/delete on the `services` table. Needs role-based checks (e.g., a specific admin claim or `app_metadata.role = 'admin'`), not just `authenticated`.

**OWASP:** A01 – Broken Access Control

### 2. ~~No Auth on API Endpoints~~ — Fixed

**Files:** `api/delete-image.js`, `api/submit-service.js`

Both endpoints are callable by anyone without authentication:

- `delete-image` lets anyone delete any Cloudinary image by guessing a public ID — no ownership check.
- `submit-service` accepts unlimited spam submissions with no rate limiting or auth.

**Fix (2026-03-16):** `delete-image` now restricts deletion to images within `CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_FOLDER/` prefix — requires env var `CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_FOLDER` in Vercel. `submit-service` rate-limits to 3 submissions per email per 24 hours via Supabase.

**OWASP:** A01 – Broken Access Control

### 3. ~~Missing Input Validation~~ — Fixed

**File:** `api/submit-service.js`

- No email format validation
- No phone format validation
- No category allowlist check (arbitrary strings accepted)
- No max-length limits on description, address, etc.

**Fix (2026-03-16):** Added category allowlist (all 105 subcategories), email/phone/URL format validation, and length limits on all fields.

**OWASP:** A03 – Injection, A08 – Software and Data Integrity Failures

---

### 4. ~~Vite Config Loads Server Secrets into `process.env`~~ — Fixed

**File:** `vite.config.js` (~L141–145)

```js
process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY ||= env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY
process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET ||= env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
// ...
```

Server-side secrets are assigned into `process.env` at build time. These should only ever exist in API handler files — never in the Vite config.

**Fix (2026-03-16):** Moved the `process.env` assignments into `configureServer`, which only runs during `vite dev` — never during `vite build`. Secrets are no longer in `process.env` at build time.

**OWASP:** A02 – Cryptographic Failures

## Medium

### 5. No Rate Limiting

**Files:** `api/submit-service.js`, `api/delete-image.js`, `api/services.js`

No rate limiting on any endpoint. Enables spam submissions, Cloudinary ID enumeration, and API flooding.

**What is currently protected:**

- `GET /api/services` has a 5min CDN cache (`s-maxage=300`), so Vercel absorbs repeated requests without hitting Supabase
- Vercel provides basic DDoS protection at the infrastructure level on all plans
- `submit-service` has a honeypot field that silently rejects simple bots

**What is not protected:**

- `POST /api/submit-service` — ~~no rate limiting~~ email-based limit added (3/24h), but IP-based limiting still missing; a bot using varied emails can still spam

**Remaining mitigation options:**

1. **Upstash Rate Limit** — free Redis-based IP rate limiting, ~5 min to add to `submit-service.js`
2. **Cloudflare Turnstile** — free CAPTCHA, unobtrusive, stops automated submissions at the form level
3. **Vercel Rate Limiting** — built-in, but requires Pro plan

**OWASP:** A04 – Insecure Design

### 6. Admin Session Check Race Condition

**File:** `src/pages/admin/AdminLayout.jsx`

`loading` state is set *after* the async `getSession()` resolves, so admin content can briefly render before the redirect fires. Loading state should be `true` by default and only set to `false` after the session check completes.

**OWASP:** A01 – Broken Access Control

---

### 7. No CSP Headers

**File:** `vercel.json`

No `Content-Security-Policy` header defined. Reduces protection against XSS at the HTTP layer.

**OWASP:** A05 – Security Misconfiguration

---

### 8. No CSRF Protection

**Files:** `api/submit-service.js`, `api/delete-image.js`

POST endpoints have no CSRF token validation. An attacker could trick a user's browser into making requests to these endpoints.
